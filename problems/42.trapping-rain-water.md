## Problem Description


```
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.


The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Thanks Marcos for contributing this image!

Example:

Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6

```

## Solution

This is a problem about how to trap rain water, and the degree is "hard". As the figure shown, it let us ask how much water we can 

accumulate after rain. If using the way of direct violence to deal with it, the idea should be to sum the height arrays one after the 

other and then add them.



Pseudocode：

```js

for(let i = 0; i < height.length; i++) {
    area += (h[i] - height[i]) * 1; // h is the water level after rainning
}

```
The question tranfers to how to caculate h, and then h[i] also equal to "The smaller of the maximum values of the left and right 

columns", there is "h[i] = Math.min(Maximum value of the left column, maximum value of the right column)"


As front figure shown that h is [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2 ,2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1]

The key of this question located in how to caculate "Maximum value of the left column" and "maximum value of the right column".
There we can use two arrays to represent `leftMax`, `rightMax`,
Take leftMax as an example, leftMax[i] stands for the Maximum value of the left column of i, So we can maintain two arrays are enough.

## Key Points

-Modeling "h[i] = Math.min(Maximum value of the left column, maximum value of the right column)" （h is the water level after rainning）

## Code

The code supports JavaScript, Python3:

JavaScript Code:

```js

/*
 * @lc app=leetcode id=42 lang=javascript
 *
 * [42] Trapping Rain Water
 *
 */
/**
 * @param {number[]} height
 * @return {number}
 */
var trap = function(height) {
    let max = 0;
    let volumn = 0;
    const leftMax = [];
    const rightMax = [];

    for(let i = 0; i < height.length; i++) {
        leftMax[i] = max = Math.max(height[i], max);
    }

    max = 0;

    for(let i = height.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        rightMax[i] = max = Math.max(height[i], max);
    }

    for(let i = 0; i < height.length; i++) {
        volumn = volumn +  Math.min(leftMax[i], rightMax[i]) - height[i]
    }

    return volumn;
};

```

Python Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(heights)
        l, r = [0] * (n + 1), [0] * (n + 1)
        ans = 0
        for i in range(1, len(heights) + 1):
            l[i] = max(l[i - 1], heights[i - 1])
        for i in range(len(heights) - 1, 0, -1):
            r[i] = max(r[i + 1], heights[i])
        for i in range(len(heights)):
            ans += max(0, min(l[i + 1], r[i]) - heights[i])
        return ans     
```
